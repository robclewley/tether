Project Tether: MoonPy

REQUIREMENTS
---------------------
This game requires Python2.5, Pygame1.8.1 or higher and PIL1.1.6 or higher in order to run successfully. The official websites for these are at:
http://www.python.org
http://www.pygame.org
http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

On linux these dependencies can be installed directly from repository on most distro's. On windows and osX these must be downloaded and installed from the internet. To assist users with verifying the correct version we host these files on our downloads page at:

RUNNING Moon.Py
---------------------
On all OS's simply run moon.py

**Special osX compatibility notes**
Because osX 10.5.x has python2.5 automatically integrated installing the dependencies isn't as straight forward as it is on other OS's. If all dependencies are installed but dependency errors are recieved try running localmoon.py instead. Further information on this issue can be found at:
