All functions not located within moon.py must be passed the 'game' object in order to work properly. This was done to avoid the necessity of having global variables. 

game.input:
Input arguments for game.input must be a Rect with the dimensions being in the following order:
left, top, width, height
So for a one-time input box that will not be used again would require something similar to the following two lines:
rectsname = Rect(left, top, width, height)
somevar = game.input(rectsname)

game.showtext
Input arguments for game.showtext is the text to be output followed by the X/Y coordinates where the text will be shown within parenthesis.
An example of this would be:
game.showtext(somevar, (Xcoord,Ycoord))

game.startanimation
Input arguments for game.statanimation is iteration with the options of cycle, backandforth, or <blank> which perform the animation only once. Following this within paranthesis is the name of the images to be displayed which must have been loaded by a previous game.loadimages function. After this is the delay between each frame. After this within paranthesis is the X/Y coordinates where the animation will be placed on screen. General format appears as this:
animation = game.startanimation(iteration(imagenames), delay, (Xcoord,Ycoord))
An example of a one-time animation would be:
animation = game.startanimation((imagenames), delay, (Xcoord,Ycoord))
as compared to cycling (looping) animation like this:
animation = game.startanimation(cycle(imagenames), delay, (Xcoord,Ycoord))

Color
color is a class located within the game module. With the way it is currently coded it is not global in scope and can only be used within the game module. As a temporary hack this class is being copied verbatim into all other modules it is needed in. A copy of this code is listed below for any new modules that may be developed before this is fixed:
class color:
    def __getattr__(self, name):
        return pygame.Color(name)
    __getitem__ = __getattr__
color = color()
