#summary Proposed coding ideas

= Introduction =

This page is a place to put code snippets and ideas on code logic for features that will be implemented later. 


= Unit descriptions =

Units will be defined by objects with the following attributes:
  * maxHP = int (max HP of the unit)
  * currentHP = int (current health of unit)
    * OMBC allowed health in half-HP increments (from cluster bomb and possibly from splash damage)
  * needstether = bool (whether or not this unit must be tethered to survive)
  * sightrange = int (distance this unit can see in FoW)
  * parent = reference (unit which this unit's tether comes from)
  * children = array of references (units which are tethered from this unit)
  * isdisabled = bool (whether unit is active or disabled)
  * isvirused = bool (whether unit is currently infected)
    * information about virus propagation needs to be stored, but this may not be the best place
