#summary Proposed coding idea

= Introduction =

This page is a place to put code snippets and ideas on code logic for features that will be implemented later. 


= Unit descriptions =

Units will be defined by objects with attributes describing them. Some general attributes all units will have are:
    * maxHP = int (max HP of the unit)
    * reqtether = bool (whether or not this unit must be tethered to survive)
    * sightrange = int (distance this unit can see in FoW)

I'm not certain if this can be done or not but I was thinking it would be useful to be able for all units to be objects similar to the game object. The difficulty I see in this is how to determine the difference between hub1 and hub2. I don't currently know enough python but something along the lines of hub(somevar).someattribute would be nice for coding purposes. *If* this can be done then we could have everything describing the units as attributes including some general attributes such as:
    * currentHP = int (current health of unit)
    * unitID = int (ID# for multiples of same unit)
    * parentID = int (variable identifying originating unit for tether dependencies)
    * istethered = bool (determines if 'tether attacks' such as spike or virus must be passed along and also if connection to 'parent' unit is lost for reqtether)
    * isdisabled = bool (whether unit is active or disabled)
    * isvirused = bool (whether unit is currently infected)
    * beenvirused = int (determines ID# of last virus to infect unit so unit only gets infected with a particular virus once)
