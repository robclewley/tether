====What is project tether?====
Project tether is an open source project focused on recreating the classic strategy game [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonbase_Commander Moonbase commander]

====What is Moonbase Commander?====
Moonbase Commander has quite often been called "the best game no one has ever heard of". Most people describe it as a unique combination of Starcraft and Scorched Earth but that doesn't say much. The best way to find out what Moonbase Commander is like is to play the game.

====Well then where can I go to play the game?====
You could do a web search to find a copy of the trial version online, or you could simply download and play [http://code.google.com/p/tether/downloads/list MoonPy].

====Moonbase Commander absolutely rocks! Why recreate something thats so perfect?====
While Moonbase Commander is a great game, there are some flaws and glitches that have never been fixed. Because the game has not received any support from the parent company for over 7 years we assume that they will never be resolved. Rather then live with it we started this project to resolve these flaws ourselves.

====What is MoonPy?====
MoonPy is an open source remake of Moonbase Commander developed by us here at project tether. It is written in python (hence the name) and is currently the only game we plan on releasing.

====How far along is MoonPy?=====
MoonPy is currently still beta but completely playable. All the units except for balloons are implemented, and since there is no FoW yet, balloons are currently unnecessary.

====How do I play MoonPy single player?====
MoonPy has been designed from the beginning for multiplayer against other people. We have no plans on ever creating a campaign for it (though if someone wants to they're more then welcome). A very basic AI called "Dumb-bot" has been implemented as of version 0.8.16 which you can fight against in multiplayer. It isn't much of a challenge but it does provide a target to practice on if you don't have anyone else to play against.

====How do I find someone to play against online?====
MoonPy doesn't have a master server yet (though one is currently being worked on) and so the only way to play is by joining directly with IP addresses. The best place to try and find someone to play against is on IRC. If you go to irc.freenode.com channel #moonpy and wait long enough, someone will eventually show up.

====I've been waiting forever for someone else to show up on IRC, how long should I wait?====
We're still a small community so it may take some time but one of the devs will show up eventually. If you really want to find people to play with, tell your friends about MoonPy. The more people that know about it, the more people that will check in and the easier it will be to find someone to play against.

====Why are you using python, why not a real programming language like C++?====
There are many reasons we're using python but the top 3 reasons are: it's simple to code, it's easily portable to different OS's, and it does what we need.

====What OS are you developing MoonPy for?====
We are intentionally making MoonPy to be fully compatible with Linux, osX, and Windows. Theoretically it should work on any OS that has python and pygame installed however we are not planning on doing compatibility testing for any other systems. 

====Will MoonPy be compatible with Moonbase Commander?====
No.

====Really? Why not?====
Mostly because Moonbase Commander is essentially dead, practically no one plays it anymore and it's almost impossible to find a *legitimate* copy of the game. What we're trying to do is hard enough already and we don't want to go through the hassle of reverse engineering everything for no real benefit. We also want to make some changes that will make MoonPy incompatible with the original even if we did manage to reverse engineer the original.

====What changes are you planning?====
The biggest change we want to make is the number of players. The original Moonbase Commander can not have more then 4 players in a single game which we find inconvenient. We would also like to add smarter AI, hotseat capabilities, and the ability to implement mods. 

====I found a bug, what do I do?====
Great, identifying them is the hardest part. First of all, check the [http://code.google.com/p/tether/issues/list issue tracker] to find out if it's already known. If it isn't please report it there and give as much detail as you can, don't forget to upload your moonpy.log file for that game when filling out the issue. You can also see if one of the developers are available on IRC as well.

====How can I help out with the project?=====
We can always use some help to keep this going. Currently the biggest help we need is people to help us identify bugs, so just downloading it, playing it, and reporting back to us would be *very* useful. In addition to help with the code we also could use graphics, sounds, music, documentation, etc. You can always check out the [http://code.google.com/p/tether/issues/list issue tracker], or post onto our [http://groups.google.com/group/project-tether mailing list]. Also just spreading the word about project tether is a big benefit to us as well.

====I've been looking through the source code archives and keep seeing mention of openRTS, is project tether a part of openRTS?====
openRTS is a completely seperate project from project tether. We have however integrated code from various other open source projects to help speed up development of project tether. The MoonPy engine is a heavily modified version of the openRTS engine and as such elements of openRTS occasionally show up, especially in older versions of MoonPy. Currently very little of the original openRTS engine remains unchanged within MoonPy, we do however have the original unedited openRTS source files deprecated on our [http://code.google.com/p/tether/downloads/list downloads page] for reference and historical purposes.
