= Hub and offense firing stats =
OMBC map editor uses a grid system for placing objects such as buildings, water, and energy. Small energy pools only take up one grid square each. By creating a special map with small energy pools being used to mark distance I was able to measure roughly how far shots travel without wind or height differences. Be aware that a single screen (not a map) is an exact 8x8 grid. 
  * Hub maximum = just under 8.5 grids (though definitely higher then 8 grids)
  * Hub minimum = exactly 2 grids
  * Offense maximum = exactly 15 grids
  * Offense minimum = exactly 2 grids
  * AA's = exactly 3 grids
  * mine = exactly 1 grid

= Tether spacing stats =
Tethers can not overlap each other. In OMBC if a player attempts to launch a tethered projectile to close to another tether a warning circle appears and the game will not allow the hub to fire. Using a blank map and firing tethers in a circle we have attempted to measure the minimum angle between tethers. As can be seen in the 2 images below:

Only 11 tethers can be placed but it isn't even. While I may have made a mistake in placing I did perform this test a couple of times and recieved this result each time. I believe that when moving the pointer OMBC checks to see if you are within 30 degrees of another tether and prevents you from firing if you are (thereby giving each individual tether a 15 degree leeway on each side). I suspect the last tether is impossible to place because while there is technically a 12th 30 degree slice capable of fitting another tether the 'warning system' see's a 1 degree overlap that really doesn't exist. On a side note I think this is something else we can fix to make the system more even. 


= Unit HP =

Amount of HP each unit has
  * Hub = 5
  * Tower = 3
  * Balloon = 1
  * Energy = 5
  * AA = 3
  * Offense = 3
  * Shield = 3
  * Crawler = 3

= Weapon Damage =

Amount of damage each weapon does with a direct hit
  * Bomb = 3
  * Missile = 3
  * Crawler = 5
  * Energy = 6
  * EMP = 2
  * Spike = 3

= Power Bar =
The power bar has 18 increments for power levels. It takes just under 3 seconds for it to make one complete pass (both up and down), sadly we unable to be more accurate in our timing. Based off our best estimates though his means it will take about 1.5 seconds for the bar to make one incomplete pass (one way). Divide this by 18 and you get 0.083+ seconds for each increment. OMBC most likely works by running the power bar at about .08 seconds per increment. This comes to 2.88 seconds for one complete pass which is would explain why it is just under 3 seconds instead of being 3 seconds exactly.

= Networking =
OMBC uses port 47624 for IP games. It uses a port somewhere between 2100 & 2800 for LAN games. We're planning on using port 6112 since we do not care about compatibility with OMBC and 6112 is a common port for other RTS games.
