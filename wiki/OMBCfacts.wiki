= Hub and offense firing stats =
OMBC map editor uses a grid system for placing objects such as buildings, water, and energy. Small energy pools only take up one grid square each. By creating a special map with small energy pools being used to mark distance I was able to measure roughly how far shots travel without wind or height differences. Be aware that a single screen (not a map) is an exact 8x8 grid. 
  * Hub maximum = just under 8.5 grids (though definitely higher then 8 grids)
  * Hub minimum = exactly 2 grids
  * Offense maximum = exactly 15 grids
  * Offense minimum = exactly 2 grids
  * AA's = exactly 3 grids
  * mine = exactly 1 grid

= Tether spacing stats =
Tethers can not overlap each other. In OMBC if a player attempts to launch a tethered projectile to close to another tether a warning circle appears and the game will not allow the hub to fire. Using a special map and firing tethers in a circle 


= Unit HP =

Amount of HP each unit has
  * Hub = 5
  * Tower = 3
  * Balloon = 1
  * Energy = 5
  * AA = 3
  * Offense = 3
  * Shield = 3
  * Crawler = 3

= Weapon Damage =

Amount of damage each weapon does with a direct hit
  * Bomb = 3
  * Missile = 3
  * Crawler = 5
  * Energy = 6
  * EMP = 2
  * Spike = 3
