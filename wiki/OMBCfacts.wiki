OMBC map editor uses a grid system for placing objects such as buildings, water, and energy. Small energy pools only take up one grid square each. By creating a special map with small energy pools being used to mark distance I was able to measure roughly how far shots travel without the aspect of wind.

  * AA's = exactly 3 grids
